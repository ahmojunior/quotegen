# quotegen
  
## Hello! üëã
I am Ahmet, and this is a simple and minimalist quote generator that uses Quotable API.  
Make sure to check out [My Github](https://github.com/ahmojunior), too!
  
## Intro üöÄ
This project is **NOT** made for daily usage.  
I do **NOT** have any right on code that is included with this repository, since i made them with ONLY **[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) 2.5 Pro**.  
  
## Prompts üìù
Here are the prompts that i used to describe my website to the Gemini 2.5 Pro.  
### Main Prompt  
Code me in HTML by making me a Home Screen for my "quote generator".  

-> Make the background color #263485, and the font color white.  
-> Make the "quote"s font BBH Sans Hegarty.  
-> Place the "quote" at the middle of the screen (or the webpage).  

-> To the top-left side of the webpage, add "QuoteGen" and make the "Quote" part of it bold, while making the "Gen" part of it slim (or thin).  
-> Add a clickable-text called "GitHub" and redirect the user to my Github page when clicked.  
-> Add the clickable-text on the right side of the "QuoteGen" text (or in this case, the logo.)  

-> Also, add a button called "Regenerate" at the bottom side of the text, while keeping a great blank space between the button and the bottom of the screen.  
### Fixes   
-> Make the corners of the regenerate button more circle-ish.  
-> Fill the inside of the button with the same color of the background while making the color of the text in the button white.  
-> Separate the HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes and make them a file one-by-one.  
-> Remove all comments in files.  

## FAQ (or the questions you might ask) ‚ùî  
¬∑ Why did you used AI only?  
We are transitioning into an era where developers won't be writing code by hand. Instead, they will have an extremely powerful and proficient tool that writes the code, and they will create things by managing what this tool generates. Although this shift may seem foreign to developers today, there is no doubt it will become the norm in the future.  
¬∑ Why you do not have any right on code that is included with this repository?  
Although I think AI's role in software development will be normalized, it's fair to say it still feels alien to me at the moment. Because of this, when I complete a job much faster simply by conceptualizing it, a job that would have otherwise required extensive hands-on work, I feel like I'm devaluing the craft itself. This code has no license, and it shouldn't. I'm not the author; I'm its manager.
